            <p><em>7minutes read.</em></p>
              <div class="row gx-4 gx-lg-5 justify-content-center">
                  <div class="col-md-10 col-lg-8 col-xl-7">
                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Word of God Came</h2>
                      <p>Anchored Scriptures: Matthew 4:1-10, Luke 3:1-2, 2 Corinthians 11:3, Romans 12:2, Philippians 4:18</p>
                      <p>In Matthew 4:1-10, we begin to see some of the mysteries of the word of God, which many believers overlook. Notice that when all these were taking place, Jesus wasn’t carrying the Bible to be seeing or finding where to read in the scriptures; as it was already inside of Him.</p>
                      <p>We fall flat before the enemy, when the word of God is not in us. So after three temptations and after ‘three it is written”, then the devil left Him, and behold; angels came and ministered unto Him.</p>
                      <p>This is a powerful passage that God has specifically put in our Bibles, to let us know the power in the word of God.
                        When you confront the enemy without the word of God in you, you will be defeated.
                        Your prayers become more potent when it has the word of God in them. Meaning that any situation you face, you must be able to say ‘it is written’; and that always is a life saver.</p>
                      <p>Now in the book of Luke 3:1-2, we are talking about power in the word of God, and why it is very crucial and important that every man must be a Bible student, every man must know the word of God, all believers must be biblically literate.
                        It is when the word of God is not in somebody and it’s not strong in a person, and the person is tossed from there to there, from that place to place; they are just moving such person about like sheep without shepherd.</p>
                      <hr>
                      <p>If you look for a scientist, and an oncologist, and you’re a child of God, you will discover very soon that if you look at how the knowledge of science and how the knowledge of things began, if you look at evolution of knowledge all over the world; you will discover very quickly that almost all disciplines came out of the Bible.</p>
                      <p>The Bible is still the king and the queen of all books. I as a scientist knows that the Bible covers all the sciences. I am aware that all the most popular and most prestigious universities emerged from cathedral schools. 
                       <p>It is the church of God that gave birth to Harvard university, Cambridge university, all those institutions; it is the church of God. It is the Ten Commandments that gave birth to all the other laws that people are bringing out now.</p>
                      <blockquote class="blockquote">Anchored Scriptures: Matthew 4:1-10, Luke 3:1-2, 2 Corinthians 11:3, Romans 12:2, Philippians 4:18</blockquote>
                      <p>All disciplines are provided for in the Bible. All disciplines took their inspirations from the Bible.
                        As far back as the time of Israel in Egypt, we see architecture, they were building pyramids. Are you talking about military strategies? Most of the military patterns came from the wars that were fought in the Bible. Are you talking about economy?
                        The principles for accountability and recording and auditing, are all in the Bible.</p>
                      <h2 class="section-heading">Whether we like it or not, God is still the greatest accountant. Because one day, all of us will one day give an account of our lives before Him.</h2>
                      <p>Is it music? The music started in heaven, it didn’t start from here. The angels are the first people to start singing. The whole of the book of psalms is actually music. 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                        The origin of choir is in the Bible.
                        Is it oceanography? The man who is called the father of oceanography first of all started to study it, after he had red psalm 8, where he red that things were passing by the paths of the sea.
                        And if you’ve ever gone to that place where they drop human beings inside the sea to see the sea, you will see that inside the sea, there are things like main roads, cross roads and intersections inside the sea.</p>

                      <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>
                      <p>If you talk about history, everybody started from Shem, Ham and Japheth (the three sons of Noah) from the time of Noah. So, the only document that talks about the past, the present and the future is the Bible.
                        Even medical science started from the Bible. Anastasia started in the Bible, God made Adam sleep and removed a bone from him.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        All technological development and inventions took their inspiration from the Bible.
                        So, we cheat ourselves seriously when we neglect Bible study.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>His parents must have told him those wonderful things that was said about him, by the angel before his birth. John must have been wondering when will all those prophecies come to pass.</p>
                      <p>Suddenly, something happened. John the Baptist that was unknown, John the Baptist that was in the desert, John the Baptist that was in an obscure place, John the Baptist that nobody was talking about, for thirty years nobody knew what he was doing, wasn’t a person to reckon with. Others were doing all kinds of things in the city but he was in the desert, others were socializing but he was in the desert, others were playing politics but he was in the desert, others were partying and fornicating but he was in the desert. But something happened to him, which we red in the book of Luke just now; the word of the Lord that will change his destiny came to him.

                        As soon as that word came to him, everything about his life changed. Last week, nobody knew him. When the word of God came to him, the direction changed. People were now rushing to the wilderness. Something came to his life that made people to rush from the city into the bush.
                        
                        Something came to him that had the capacity to draw people from Jerusalem, Judea and everybody to him.</p>
